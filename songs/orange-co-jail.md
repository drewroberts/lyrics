Well I woke up drunk in a cell
Somewhere in the Orange County Jail
And I don't know where I went wrong
If it weren't for bad times,
I wouldn't have no time at all

So I call and hope once again
Put my heart on the other end
Oh, but darlin', she's far from that phone
If it weren't for bad love, 
I wouldn't have no love at all

So if I make it, darlin', I swear
I'll never call you again
But they got my back to the wall
If it weren't for you friend,
I wouldn't have no friend at all

What am I to do
With my weekend on some hog
Stumblin' like a child
Feelin' lost out in the dark

So I been livin' out on the edge
And I'll be this way 'til I'm dead
I've been down since the day I was born
If it weren't for bad luck, 
I wouldn't have no luck at all

If it weren't for bad luck, 
I wouldn't have no luck at all
