Been beat down, but I don't stay low
Got mud on my jeans, still ready to go
Every scar's a story that I survived
I've been through hell, but I'm still alive
They said, "Slow down, boy, don't go too fast"
But I ain't never been one to live in the past
I keep moving forward, never looking back
With a worn-out hat and a six-string strap
You can kick rocks if you don't like how I talk
I'ma keep on talking and walk my walk
Ain't changing my tone, ain't changing my song
I was born this way, been loud too long
You can hate my style, you can roll your eyes
But I ain't slowing down, I was born to rise
So kick them rocks if you don't like how I talk
I'ma keep on talking and walk my walk
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
I've lost some friends, made a few new foes
But that's just life, that's how it goes
I ain't bending over just to please a crowd
If I fall down, I'll fall down proud
I'll talk my truth, I'll live my way
Ain't nobody gonna take my say
This road's been rough but I learned to trade this sweat
Soul and dues I paid, you can kick rocks
If you don't like how I talk
I'm gon' keep on talkin' and walk my walk
Ain't changin' my tone, ain't changin' my song
I was born this way, been loud too long
You can hate my style, you can roll your eyes
But I ain't slowin' down, I was born to rise
So kick them rocks if you don't like how I talk
I'm gon' keep on talkin' and walk my walk
Let the haters talk, let the rumors fly
I ain't got time to wonder why
The good Lord knows the man I am
And I'll die standing tall with a mic in my hand
You can kick rocks if you don't like how I talk
I'ma keep on talking and walk my walk
Ain't selling my soul for a seat at your table, I'm rough
I'm raw, I'm wild, I'm able
You can hate my fire but you can't kill my spark
I'm a midnight flame burning through the dark
So kick them rocks if you don't like how I talk
I'm gon' keep on talking and walk my walk
You can kick rocks
You can kick rocks
You can kick rocks
I'ma keep on talkin' and walkin' my walk
