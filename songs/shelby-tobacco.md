Hardest work that ever I done
Been beneath that burning sun
Hauling tobacco around to cure
I would chop that wicked weed
Till our hands and fingers bleed
Working like a mule, maybe more
We been farming on this land
Since eighteen hundred ten
Through flood, drought, pestilence and war
Now I sure am sad to say
That I've lived to see this day
And we don't grow tobacco around here no more
We don't grow, we don't grow
Oh, it's still the only work we'll ever know
We don't grow, we don't grow
We don't grow tobacco around here no more
Grandpa told me this, I know
Change is coming, won't be slow
Knocking just like a thunder at the door
Fallow fields are all around
Empty barns just falling down
With iron weeds coming up through the floor
Once we growed it by the pound
Now the kids all moved to town
And all that's left are elderly and poor
Now I sure am sad to say
That I've lived to see this day
And we don't grow tobacco around here no more
We don't grow, we don't grow
Oh, it's still the only work we'll ever know
We don't grow, we don't grow
We don't grow tobacco around here no more
Ooh, yes, I sure am sad to say
This way of life has gone away
Now that we don't grow tobacco around here no more
Well, no, we don't grow tobacco around here no more
