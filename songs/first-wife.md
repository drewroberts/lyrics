She was right there — always
Not just in body, but in presence
Held space like a prayer
Even when i barely said a sentence
She smiled through my silence
Waited through my moods
Let my distance feel like normal
When all she ever brought was truth
She built a home with her eyes
I stayed sleepin' on the porch
And every time she opened the door
I acted like love was a chore
She leaned in
I leaned out
She spoke with warmth
I spoke in doubt
She gave me time
I gave her space
She wanted love
I needed escape
She was right there — holdin' me close
While I wandered off, chasin' my ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
I just kept standin' still while she made moves
He never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and I don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause I was never fully here
She waited through my storms, bare-skinned and brave
Let my manias pass, hopin' I'd change
I talked 'bout goals — she was right there with the map
But I kept chasin' dreams that never looked back
It wasn't that I hated her
I just never chose her
Kept her as a comfort
While I searched for closure
She didn't want perfect
Just real and present
But I treated love like a side quest
Not a blessing
She gave me grace
I gave her gray
She opened doors
I walked away
She tried to wait
But time ran thin
So she packed her worth
And walked back in
She was right there — holdin' me close
While I wandered off, chasin' my ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
I just kept standin' still while she made moves
I never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and I don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause I was never fully here
One day she woke up
And the ache was gone
She looked around
And knew she didn't belong
Not in a maybe
Not in a half-built try
She kissed him soft
And said goodbye
No fire, no fight
Just peace in her chest
Sometimes walkin' away
Is love at its best
She was right there — holdin' me close
While I wandered off, chasin' my ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
I just kept standin' still while she made moves
I never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and I don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause he was never fully here
She was never fully there
