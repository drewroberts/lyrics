She was right there — always
Not just in body, but in presence
Held space like a prayer
Even when he barely said a sentence
She smiled through his silence
Waited through his moods
Let his distance feel like normal
When all she ever brought was truth
She built a home with her eyes
He stayed sleepin' on the porch
And every time she opened the door
He acted like love was a chore
She leaned in
He leaned out
She spoke with warmth
He spoke in doubt
She gave him time
He gave her space
She wanted love
He needed escape
She was right there — holdin' him close
While he wandered off, chasin' his ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
He just kept standin' still while she made moves
He never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and he don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause he was never fully here
She waited through his storms, bare-skinned and brave
Let his cold fronts pass, hopin' he'd change
He talked 'bout goals — she was right there with the map
But he kept chasin' dreams that never looked back
It wasn't that he hated her
He just never chose her
Kept her as a comfort
While he searched for closure
She didn't want perfect
Just real and present
But he treated love like a side quest
Not a blessing
She gave him grace
He gave her gray
She opened doors
He walked away
She tried to wait
But time ran thin
So she packed her worth
And walked back in
She was right there — holdin' him close
While he wandered off, chasin' his ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
He just kept standin' still while she made moves
He never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and he don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause he was never fully here
One day she woke up
And the ache was gone
She looked around
And knew she didn't belong
Not in a maybe
Not in a half-built try
She kissed him soft
And said goodbye
No fire, no fight
Just peace in her chest
Sometimes walkin' away
Is love at its best
She was right there — holdin' him close
While he wandered off, chasin' his ghosts
She gave her heart, with nothin' to prove
He just kept standin' still while she made moves
He never saw the gold in her hands
Now she's gone, and he don't understand
She didn't leave outta rage or fear
She left 'cause he was never fully here
She was never fully there
