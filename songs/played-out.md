Trail's gone cold, here comes the rain
Been chewin' on Copenhagen to hold back the pain
Puttin' juice in the wound, lettin' it drain
Holes in my Converse still wet with bloodstains
Been pushin' too hard, and goin insane
Lord, don't let this journey be all in vain

'Cause I'm played out, down to my last draw
This shitcoin feelin' is startin' to gnaw
It's the saddest deployer you ever saw
Played out and ridin', rough ragged and raw

Stayin' up on the ridge, tryin' to keep the high ground
Wallet is throbbin' and I'm windin' down
Red candle is bobbin' and I don't hear the hound
After five days and nights followin' the sound
Doginal dogs are silent, dey nowhere to be found
Oh wait, I see them, lyin' there on the ground

Oh we're played out, rug pulled and blood raw
Torn plumb all to pieces, done worn off his paw
Then old Sam let out his last dyin' bay call
So I dug him a grave, covered it all
