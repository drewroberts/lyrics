I was just a normal guy
Life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure piled-up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd bewen
Hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly
Three days straight was no big feat
To get by on no food or sleep
And crazy was becoming my new normal
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
Sleep right through the calm before the storm
My life was just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothing like the cost of livin' high
That southern Baptist parking lot
Was where I'd go to smoke my pot
And sit there in my pickup truck and pray
And starin' at that giant cross
Just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way
As soon as Jesus turned his back
I'd found my way across the track
Lookin' just to score another deal
With my back against blockchain wall
I didn't have to think or talk or feel
My life was just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothing like the cost of livin' high
My whole life went through my head
Layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land
My sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for shitcoins & sol poor
With my new found sobriety
I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had and threw away
This prison is much colder
Than that one that I was locked-up in just yesterday
My life is just an old routine
Every day the same damn thing
Hell, I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothing like the cost of livin' high
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothing like the cost of livin' high
Just leave that stuff alone
