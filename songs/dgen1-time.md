I've been broke, been bruised, been used
Had folks talking like they know my shoes
Ain't no saint, I raised some hell
But I learned my peace where my demons dwell
I quit chasing ghosts that don't pay rent, mmh
Quit worrying about the ones who went
Now I walk my road, dust on my boots
Singin' my truth, whatever it roots
'Cause I don't give a damn who don't like me
This world spins fast and time ain't free
We're all just sparks in the midnight sky
Fading out slow, sayin' goodbye
So pour that whiskey, let it burn fire
Laugh at the scars that prove I'm alive
We're all just livin', hm
On degenerate time
Had some lovers, lost some friends
Some stories start, some just end
Each token launch is jaded & mean
Of all them larps with 100x dreams
And I don't beg, I don't chase
Don't need no crown, I got my grace
Life's too short to wear a mask
So I will say my piece and sip my flask
'Cause I don't give a damn who don't like me
This world spins fast and time ain't free
We're all just sparks in the midnight sky
Fading out slow, sayin' goodbye
So pour that whiskey, let it burn fire
Laugh at the scars that prove I'm alive
We're all just livin', mmh
On degenerate time
Yeah, the clock don't stop, it don't rewind
You blink and you're forty, damn near blind
So love who you love and cuss when you need
Be your own man, that's all you can be
I don't give a damn who don't like me
Made my peace, my soul set free
We're all just sparks in a stormy sky
Burning out bright before we die
So raise that glass, let it hit just right
Here is to the truth and the dirt and the fight
Yeah, we're all just livin'
On degenerate time
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't give a damn
