Well I ain't the kind of man
Who'd turn and run from a fight
Got no money in my pockets
All I carry these days is my old man's knife
I ain't sweating for my wages
I'm just fighting demons, raging in the dark
Between memories and broken dreams
I ain't sure there's a real good place to start
Well I'm pretty good at playing roles
I've been acting like I'm something that I'm not for a while
I've been running from my nature
Trying to change it
But turns out there's plenty parts of me
That ain't worth saving
I'm a no good son of a
Preacher man
With a smoking habit
In a one piece band
Not a clue in the world what I'm doing
Or where I'm bound
And I'm running awful low on
Give a damn's
And I'm trying to learn to accept who I am
I ain't asking for approval anymore
Papa, I'm grown now
I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna make you proud
Well I had a dream the other night that
I was standing in a stage
In the shadows of the crowd
I swear to God I saw your face
You came to me with open arms
And told me you were proud of who I was
But I woke up alone again
And I can't face the man that I've become
Still I'm pretty good at playing roles
I've been acting like I'm something
That I'm not for a while
I've been running from my nature
Trying to change it
But turns out there's plenty parts of me
Ain't worth saving
I'm a no good son of a
Preacher man
With a smoking habit
In a one piece band
Not a clue in the world what I'm doing
Or where I'm bound
And I'm running awful low on
Give a damn's
And I'm trying to learn to accept who I am
I ain't asking for approval anymore
Papa, I'm grown now
I'm gonna make you proud
I'm gonna make you proud
