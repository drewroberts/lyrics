Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
I'm gonna kneel and pray every day
At least I should become vain along the way
I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna learn the best way to walk
I'm gonna search and find a better way to talk
I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough edged self
'Til I get rid of every single flaw
I'm gonna be the world's best friend
I'm gonna go round shaking everybody's hand
Hey, I'm gonna be the cotton pickin' rage of the age
I'm gonna be a diamond some day
Now I'm just an old chunk of coal
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue pure perfect
I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
I'm gonna kneel and pray every day
At least I should become vain along the way
Hey, I'm just an old chunk of coal now old
But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
